The [<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shepherd Police Department</span></span>](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shepherd-Police-Department/205632619455314?fref=nf) posted the following announcement this week:

ROAD CLOSURE

Starting Monday June 1st 2015 Wright avenue in Shepherd Between Federal/Blanchard road to First street will be closed for road work and repair. There will be no through traffic during the construction period which will last probably into August. Please take extra time and prepare to use the detour down Federal road to Pleasant Valley and then onto Shepherd/Chippewa Road and back into town.

Enforcement of the road closure will occur to assure that the the construction crew remains safe and that the project can be completed before the fall.

During the first week of construction school will be in session. I'm asking that vehicular traffic coming in on the detour go to Wright avenue and Chippewa and then back to Fourth street to gain access to the school. Maple Street is to narrow for a major increase of traffic like this, not to mention the students who are walking/crossing at the intersections.
